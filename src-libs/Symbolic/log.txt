cabal: There is no <pkgname>.cabal package file or cabal.project file. To
build packages locally you need at minimum a <pkgname>.cabal file. You can use
'cabal init' to create one.

For non-trivial projects you will also want a cabal.project file in the root
directory of your project. This file lists the packages in your project and
all other build configuration. See the Cabal user guide for full details.
